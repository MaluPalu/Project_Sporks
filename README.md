# README

## Description:

Spork is a social cooking app designed to help connect a community of aspiring chefs. Users can create and account to upload their own recipes, review recipes of other food lovers and even follow their favorite cooks to increase their cooking acumen and stay inspired. Users can also save all their favorite recipes directly in their profile, and search by the ingredients in their fridge for quick meal ideas.


## User stories

From anywhere on the site visitors can create a profile, search the database of recipes, and log into the site. Once logged in, users can see their profile, create, edit, and/or delete their own recipes and favorite the recipes of other users. Users can also follow users to be notified when they add new recipes or write new reviews.

## Wish List / Future Features

Future releases of Spork will include some kind of badgification which rewards users for uploading and reviewing recipes, as well as comments or instant messaging to allow users to communicate more directly with each other. Food categories and a more precise search are also on the product roadmap. Another future feature will be more high level notifications on the activity feeds to give users a faster snapshot of what activities in particular their friends are up to.
